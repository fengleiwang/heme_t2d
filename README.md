## Heme iron intake and increased type 2 diabetes risk revealed by integrated epidemiological and biomarker analysis

### Code files in this repository covers the main analyses:

### 1. Metabolome-wide association analysis to assess the association between individual metabolite and mortality/longevity;

### 2. Metaboltie set enrichment analysis (MSEA) to examine the association between knowledge-based metabolite groups and mortality/longevity;

### 3. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to examine the association between metabolite modules, derived using a data-driven approach, and mortality/longevity;

### 4. Elastic net regression to develop a multi-profile score summarizing the plasma metabolomic profile associated with all-cause mortality.
